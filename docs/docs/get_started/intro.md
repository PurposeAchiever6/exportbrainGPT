## Getting Started: üöÄ

Follow these instructions to get a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

You can find everything on the documentation [here](https://brain.quivr.app/)

### Prerequisites üìã

Before you proceed, ensure you have the following installed:

- Docker
- Docker Compose

Additionally, you'll need a [Supabase](https://supabase.com/) account for:

- Creating a new Supabase project
- Supabase Project API key
- Supabase Project URL

### Installation Steps üíΩ

- **Step 0**: If needed, here is the installation explained on Youtube [here](https://youtu.be/rC-s4QdfY80)

- **Step 1**: Clone the repository using **one** of these commands:

  - If you don't have an SSH key set up:

  ```bash
  git clone https://github.com/StanGirard/Quivr.git && cd Quivr
  ```

  - If you have an SSH key set up or want to add it ([guide here](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/connecting-to-github-with-ssh/adding-a-new-ssh-key-to-your-github-account))

  ```bash
  git clone git@github.com:StanGirard/Quivr.git && cd Quivr
  ```

- **Step 2**: Copy the `.XXXXX_env` files

```bash
cp .backend_env.example backend/core/.env
cp .frontend_env.example frontend/.env
```

- **Step 3**: Update the `backend/core/.env` and `frontend/.env` file

> _Your `supabase_service_key` can be found in your Supabase dashboard under Project Settings -> API. Use the `anon` `public` key found in the `Project API keys` section._

> _Your `JWT_SECRET_KEY`can be found in your supabase settings under Project Settings -> API -> JWT Settings -> JWT Secret_

> _The `NEXT_PUBLIC_BACKEND_URL` is set to localhost:5050 for the docker. Update it if you are running the backend on a different machine._

> _To activate vertexAI with PaLM from GCP follow the instructions [here](https://python.langchain.com/en/latest/modules/models/llms/integrations/google_vertex_ai_palm.html) and update `backend/core/.env`- It is an advanced feature, please be expert in GCP before trying to use it_

- [ ] Change variables in `backend/core/.env`
- [ ] Change variables in `frontend/.env`

- **Step 4**: Create your database tables and functions with one of these two options:
  a. Run the following migration scripts on the Supabase database via the web interface (SQL Editor -> `New query`)

[Creation Script 1](https://github.com/stangirard/quivr/tree/main/scripts/tables.sql)

b. Use the `migration.sh` script to run the migration scripts

    ```bash
    chmod +x migration.sh
    ./migration.sh
    ```

    Choose either create_scripts if it's your first time or migrations if you are updating your database.

All the scripts can be found in the [scripts](https://github.com/stangirard/quivr/tree/main/scripts) folder

> _If you come from an old version of Quivr, run the scripts in [migration script](https://github.com/stangirard/quivr/tree/main/scripts) to migrate your data to the new version in the order of date_

- **Step 5**: Launch the app

```bash
docker compose -f docker-compose.yml up --build
```

- **Step 6**: Navigate to `localhost:3000` in your browser
